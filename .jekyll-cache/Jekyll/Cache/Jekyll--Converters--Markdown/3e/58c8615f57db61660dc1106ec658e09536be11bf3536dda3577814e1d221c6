I"—<p><img src="/news/images/2016.png" alt="2016 news" title="2016 news" />Hi! So long, no see :-) Iâ€™ve not updated the website in a while, even if Iâ€™ve kept working on it and my products. In the meantime Iâ€™ve also published a <a href="http://htmlpanelsbook.com">book on HTML Panels development</a>! As youâ€™ve noticed Iâ€™ve moved to a different domain (CC-Extensions instead of CS) because if the Creative Suite is dead, long live the Creative Cloudâ€¦</p>

<p>In the future youâ€™ll see new products and updates appear here, and also guest posts from Fixel Algorithms. Keep checking, and if you want subscribe to my (low traffic, no spam) newsletter.</p>
