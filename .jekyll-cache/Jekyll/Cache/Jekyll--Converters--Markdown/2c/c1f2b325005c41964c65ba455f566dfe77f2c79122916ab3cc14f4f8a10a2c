I"ƒ<p><img src="/news/images/Certificate.png" alt="Code Certificates" title="Code Certificates" />Due to Code Signing Certificate expiration (a file that Iâ€™ve bought and attests that I am who I am, for 365 days â€“ and itâ€™s needed to pack product installers) Extensions and Script for download on Adobe Exchange may give <strong>installation / use problems â€“ mainly on CS6</strong>.</p>

<p>New installer for all my products have been uploaded to Exchange. Please also check to have the latest <a href="http://www.adobe.com/exchange/em_download/" title="Adobe Extension Manager Download">Adobe Extension Manager</a> version available.</p>
