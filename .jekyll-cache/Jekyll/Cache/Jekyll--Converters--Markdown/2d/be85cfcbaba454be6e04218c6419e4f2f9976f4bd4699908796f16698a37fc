<p>These are known issues and Adobe engineers are working on a fix. In the meantime, I‚Äôve collected their suggestion in a <a href="http://www.davidebarranca.com/2013/06/adobe-extension-manager-cc-and-exchange-issues/" title="Troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> page that I recommend you to read.</p>
