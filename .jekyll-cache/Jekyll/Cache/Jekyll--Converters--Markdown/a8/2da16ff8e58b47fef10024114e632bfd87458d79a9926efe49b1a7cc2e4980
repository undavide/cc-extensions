I"n<p><img src="/news/images/jekyllcs.png" alt="Jekyll Redesign" title="CS Extensions website redesign" />As you have hopefully noticed, I’ve rebuilt the cs-extensions website from the ground up - it’s now <em>way faster</em>, lighter and nicer too. I’ve kissed bye bye Wordpress with no regrets: the whole thing is now static, handcrafted with Bootstrap and based on Jekyll.</p>

<p>I’ve added <em>two new products</em> in the lineup, namely <a href="/products/vitaminbw" title="Vitamin BW - Spice up your Black &amp; White conversions!">Vitamin BW</a> and <a href="/products/parametriccurves" title="Parametric Curves - Plot Curves adjustment layers">Parametric Curves</a> - check them out!</p>

<p>90% of the content is brand new: it’s worth mentioning that Documentation is now referenced within each product page and there’s no more a centralized collection.</p>
