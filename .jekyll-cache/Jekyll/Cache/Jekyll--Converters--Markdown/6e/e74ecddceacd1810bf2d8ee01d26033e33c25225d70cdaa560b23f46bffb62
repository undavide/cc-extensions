This has been recognized as a known bug, which affects all the panels around, and gosh there’s no ETA for the fix too!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Latest Photoshop CS6 update (Perpetual Product: 13.0.5) finally solves the problem. Strangely enough, the Subscription product (13.1.2) still shows the error. Many users, included myself, have reported issues while installing the update: basically, you’ve to uninstall CS6 and reinstall it from the ground up then the patch will apply correctly.</p>
