I"<p><img src="/news/images/AdobeExchange.png" alt="Adobe Add-ons" title="Adobe Exchange 2012" /><a href="https://creative.adobe.com/addons/" title="Adobe Add-ons website">Adobe Add-ons</a> is replacing the Exchange Panel as the new, improved Creative Cloud Extensions official store.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entirely web based and responsive</li>
  <li>Buy and install products from any device (mobile included)</li>
  <li>Bypass Adobe Extension Manager altogether!</li>
  <li>Synchronize purchases and installations through Creative Cloud file sharing</li>
</ul>

<p>Adobe Add-ons is for CC products only. CS6 users can still rely on the <a href="https://www.adobeexchange.com/panel" title="Adobe Exchange panel for CS6">Adobe Exchange Panel</a>, which wonâ€™t work anymore in Photoshop CC-next.</p>
