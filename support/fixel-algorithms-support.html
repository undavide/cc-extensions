									<li>On the left column click the <b>My Add-ons / All your purchased and shared items</b> link.</li>

							<dt>How do I use a ZXP installer?</dt>
							<dd>Don't try to open it with Photoshop, you need the free Adobe Extension Manager:
							<ul>
								<li>If you don't have it: <a href="https://www.adobe.com/exchange/em_download/" target="_blank">download it here</a>.</li>
								<li>If you already have it: please make sure it is <a href="https://www.adobe.com/exchange/em_updates/" target="_blank">updated to the latest version</a>.</li>
							</ul>
							When you have the latest version of Adobe Extension Manager, if you're on Windows right-click on it and <b>"Run As Administrator"</b>, so that Windows won't complain when it will install the product.
							<br>
							Shut down Photoshop and in Adobe Extension Manager either click the "Install" button (top-right corner) or choose the File > Install Extension menu item and browse to the Fixel product's ZXP file. Follow the instruction.

						<div class="def">
							<dt>None of the above worked, what can I do?</dt>
							<dd>If you bought the product from a Deals website, the ZIP you've downloaded already contains the assets and instruction for a <b>Manual Installation</b>, so go ahead with it. It's a matter of moving few files around in a couple of folders, the instruction will thoroughly guide you through the process. <br>
							If you bought via Adobe Add-on, get in touch with me with a proof of the purchase and I will send you everything you need (see my email at the bottom of the page).</dd>

							<dd>You'll find it in the <b>Filter</b> menu and - when provided - as a panel in the Window > Extensions menu (Detailizer only). Use the menu elements at the bottom of the Filter's list, <b>not</b> the ones in the Fixel Algorithms submenu.</dd>

								Please make sure to use, in the Filter menu, the items that are at the bottom and <b>not</b> the ones within a "Fixel Algorithms" submenu (which are there for technical and support reasons).

							<dt>Photoshop crashes, can you fix it?</dt>
							<dd>Sure.<br>Fixel's products uses advanced features of computer's CPU to be as fast as possible - if your machine is a bit old we can build a customized filter for your very CPU.<br>
							First try to use (that's for support only! Do <b>not</b> do this normally!) the Filters that you find within the Filter > Fixel Algorithms submenu (e.g. Filter > Fixel Algorithms > Fixel Detailizer 2). Normally, it won't do anything: it doesn't show the user interface, it doesn't modify the image, it is for debugging purposes only. 
							<br>
							Does it crash anyway? If this is the case, please get in touch with us at fixel@fixelalgorithms.com and we'll provide you with a customized filter.</dd>
