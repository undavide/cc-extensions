							<dt>How do I buy?</dt>
							<dd>You have two options: 
							<ul>
								<li>Directly from the developers (who will &#9829 you) on this website.</li>
								<li>Through <a href="/buy">Adobe Add-ons</a>, the official Adobe web-based app store, for Photoshop from CC to CC2015.5 (CS6 relies on the Adobe Exchange panel).</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>How can I pay?</dt>
							<dd>The e-commerce provider for both this website and Adobe Exchange is <a href="http://www.fastspring.com" target="_blank">Fastspring</a>; it manages Visa®, Mastercard®, American Express®, Discover®, JCB®, PayPal, bank transfer, check, money order, and purchase order. Payments are accepted in ten major currencies in addition to the US Dollar.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>Can I install your products in all of my computers?</dt>
							<dd>No limits for us, as long as you work on a licensed Photoshop copy (Adobe applies restrictions for <a href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/creativecloud/faq.html" target="_blank">Creative Cloud</a> though).</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>Adobe Exchange is CC/CS6 only, I need CS5, CS4 or CS3</dt>
							 <dd>Some of our products support earlier versions too, look for them in our partener's <a href="https://store.bigano.com">website</a>.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>Do you provide any support?</dt>
							<dd>You’re going to get a lifetime e-mail support – since late 2009, we got past >99% support requests successfully. Documentation is found within each product's page.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>Do you know me?</dt>
							<dd>I'm afraid I don't, if you buy throgh Add-ons: because of privacy and legal matters, Adobe doesn't share with us producers any detail about you. For this reason I gently ask you to subscribe to our mailing list (I don't spam) in order to get news about products and updates. Conversely, if you buy from this website, I receive your order's data (name, email, etc).</dd>

							<dt>I bought a Fixel Algorithms product and I need support!</dt>
							<dd>I've set up a dedicated support page for Fixel Algorithms, that will help you troubleshooting, please find it <a href="fixel-algorithms-support.html">here</a>.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>How do I install Extensions?</dt>
							<dd>Products bought from CC-Extension are delivered as manual installers, instruction included (the most reliable way to deploy panels and scripts). Conversely, Adobe Add-ons relies upon the File Sync feature of the Creative Cloud application for the installation process. In case of problems, get in touch with me and I'll provide you with assets for manual installation.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>Adobe Extension Manager (AEM) does weird things, help!</dt>
							<dd>AEM has been discontinued, so it's useless to install products. Please use manual installers or the automatic installation via the Creative Cloud app.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>Do your extensions run 64bit?</dt>
							<dd>As long as you’re running Photoshop as a 64bit application, so the extensions do.</dd>

						<div class="def">
							<dt>I'm still having issues, how do I get in touch with you?</dt>
							<dd>Please find my email at the bottom left of this page.</dd>
