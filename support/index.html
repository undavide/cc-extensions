							<dt>How do I buy?</dt>
							<dd>Trough <a href="/buy">Adobe Add-ons</a>, the official Adobe web-based app store for Photoshop CC and CC 2014 (CS6 relies on the Adobe Exchange panel).</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>How can I pay?</dt>
							<dd>Adobe Exchange relies on <a href="http://www.fastspring.com" target="_blank">Fastspring</a> for the e-commerce; they manage Visa®, Mastercard®, American Express®, Discover®, JCB®, PayPal, bank transfer, check, money order, and purchase order. Payments are accepted in ten major currencies in addition to the US Dollar.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>Can I install your products in all of my computers?</dt>
							<dd>No limits for us, as long as you work on a licensed Photoshop copy (Adobe applies restrictions for <a href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/creativecloud/faq.html" target="_blank">Creative Cloud</a> though).</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>Who am I buying extensions from, Adobe Exchange or you?</dt>
							<dd>We build products, the entire selling experience is managed by Adobe (their servers, databases, product deployment system, etc). This website’s sole purpose is to give you information, there’s no e-commerce here.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>Adobe Exchange is CC/CS6 only, I need CS5, CS4 or CS3</dt>
							 <dd>Some of our products support earlier versions too, look for them in our partener's <a href="https://store.bigano.com">website</a>.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>Do you provide any support?</dt>
							<dd>You’re going to get a lifetime e-mail support – since late 2009, we got past all support requests successfully (but one, snap!). Documentation is found within each product's page.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>Do you know me?</dt>
							<dd>I'm afraid I don't. Because of privacy and legal matters, Adobe doesn't share with us producers <em>any detail</em> about you. For this reason I gently ask you to subscribe to our mailing list (I don't spam) in order to get news about products and updates.</dd>

					<h3 class="faq-subtitle">Technical</h3>
					<dl class="feature-text">
						<div class="def">
							<dt>I bought a Fixel Algorithms product and I need support!</dt>
							<dd>I've set up a dedicated support page for Detailizer and Contrastica that will help you troubleshooting, please find it <a href="fixel-algorithms-support.html">here</a>.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>How do I install Extensions?</dt>
							<dd>The Adobe Add-ons website is in charge of the process, that relies upon the File Sync feature of the Creative Cloud application. A Photoshop reboot may be required.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>Can I backup the installers?</dt>
							<dd>Each purchase is linked to your account and listed in your Adobe Add-ons page. You don't need to backup the installers since they already belong to your cloud and you can download/install them each time you need.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>How do I install an Extension on a different computer?</dt>
							<dd>Log-in the Adobe Add-ons website with the credential you used when purchasing (your AdobeID and password), you'll find in your page the products you own and you can install from there.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>Adobe Extension Manager does weird things, help!</dt>
							<dd>As long as you’re referring to red alerts, it’s safe to ignore them. Conversely, if Extension Manager doesn’t recognize your Photoshop version or shows similar, unexpected behaviors please check if you’re running <a href="http://www.adobe.com/exchange/em_download/" target="_blank">the latest version</a>.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>Do your extensions run 64bit?</dt>
							<dd>As long as you’re running Photoshop as a 64bit application, so the extensions do.</dd>
