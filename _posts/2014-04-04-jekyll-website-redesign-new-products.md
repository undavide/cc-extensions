![Jekyll Redesign][a]As you have hopefully noticed, I've rebuilt the cs-extensions website from the ground up - it's now *way faster*, lighter and nicer too. I've kissed bye bye Wordpress with no regrets: the whole thing is now static, handcrafted with Bootstrap and based on Jekyll.

I've added *two new products* in the lineup, namely [Vitamin BW][1] and [Parametric Curves][2] - check them out!

90% of the content is brand new: it's worth mentioning that Documentation is now referenced within each product page and there's no more a centralized collection.
