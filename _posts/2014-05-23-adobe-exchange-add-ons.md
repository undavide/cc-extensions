![Adobe Add-ons][a][Adobe Add-ons][1] is replacing the Exchange Panel as the new, improved Creative Cloud Extensions official store.

* Entirely web based and responsive
* Buy and install products from any device (mobile included)
* Bypass Adobe Extension Manager altogether!
* Synchronize purchases and installations through Creative Cloud file sharing

Adobe Add-ons is for CC products only. CS6 users can still rely on the [Adobe Exchange Panel][2], which won't work anymore in Photoshop CC-next.
