![Double USM][a]I'm happy to announce that Double USM 1.0.1 has added the Windows support - so PC users can finally enjoy this sharpening script!

The product on Exchange is called &#8220;Double USM (Windows)&#8221;: it's identical to the Mac version but for the fact that Panning (navigating through the document with the Hand tool) is not enabled due to scripting limitation on the PC side.
