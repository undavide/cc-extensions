![Extension Manager][a]Adobe Extension Manager CC may pop up error messages when installing extensions via the Adobe Exchange panel. Typically, something like:
> "Error occurred during copying file... to... The extension will not be installed."

These are known issues and Adobe engineers are working on a fix. In the meantime, Iâ€™ve collected their suggestion in a [troubleshooting][1] page that I recommend you to read.
