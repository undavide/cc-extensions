![Code Certificates][a]Due to Code Signing Certificate expiration (a file that I&#8217;ve bought and attests that I am who I am, for 365 days &#8211; and it&#8217;s needed to pack product installers) Extensions and Script for download on Adobe Exchange may give **installation / use problems &#8211; mainly on CS6**.

New installer for all my products have been uploaded to Exchange. Please also check to have the latest [Adobe Extension Manager][1] version available.
