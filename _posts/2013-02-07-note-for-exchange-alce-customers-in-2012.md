![Adobe Exchange][a]If you have bought ALCE from Exchange in the year 2012 (or before late January 2013) and you can prove it, please [contact us][1]. We've moved the product from an Exchange Producer Account to a different one (from *RBG* to *Davide Barranca*), and you may not see updates. There's an easy fix so don't hesitate! Thanks.
