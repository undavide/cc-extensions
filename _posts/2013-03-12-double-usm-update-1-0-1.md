![Double USM][a]I've just released an update for Double USM, which now reaches version 1.0.1. Release notes as follows: 

**NEW**: Double USM remembers last used parameters.  
**CHANGE**: Replaced the Fit-on-Screen button with 100% Zoom.  
**FIX**: Selecting a layer which has a mask now outputs correct results.

Coming next: **Presets**. I've also, finally, submitted for approval a **Windows (PC)** version, it should be a matter of few days to have it on Exchange, stay tuned!
