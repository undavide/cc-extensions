![Adobe Exchange][a]We’re proud to have appeared in the Adobe Exchange public preview launch day as a featured product with [ALCE][1] our Advanced Local Contrast Enhancer extension for Photoshop CS6! I’ve personally been extensions fan since they first appeared in CS4, and over time I’ve followed their evolution as a coder; I’m happy to have been given the opportunity to be part of the Exchange’s early development stages – I’m sure exciting times will follow.
