![PSProjects][a]I’m happy to announce the release of [PS Projects][1] 1.0, my latest script for Photoshop CC/CS6 (Mac + PC) – that implements Projects: lightweight, encrypted files that reference sets of images that you might want to group and open all at once in Photoshop frequently.
PS Projects is available for sale on [Adobe Exchange][2] for USD 14.95.
