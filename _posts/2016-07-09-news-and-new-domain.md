![2016 news][a]Hi! So long, no see :-) I've not updated the website in a while, even if I've kept working on it and my products. In the meantime I've also published a [book on HTML Panels development](http://htmlpanelsbook.com)! As you've noticed I've moved to a different domain (CC-Extensions instead of CS) because if the Creative Suite is dead, long live the Creative Cloud...

In the future you'll see new products and updates appear here, and also guest posts from Fixel Algorithms. Keep checking, and if you want subscribe to my (low traffic, no spam) newsletter.
