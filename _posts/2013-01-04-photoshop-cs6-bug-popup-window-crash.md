![Popup Bug][a]The newest Photoshop update *(Creative Cloud: 13.1.x – Single Product: 13.0.x)* is quite unlucky: besides the icon’s bug I’ve already mentioned, every panel that tries to open an extension’s pop-up window (ALCE Settings or Info, as an example) makes Photoshop crash wildly. This has been recognized as a known bug, which affects all the panels around, and gosh there’s no ETA for the fix too!

**UPDATE**: Latest Photoshop CS6 update (Perpetual Product: 13.0.5) finally solves the problem. Strangely enough, the Subscription product (13.1.2) still shows the error. Many users, included myself, have reported issues while installing the update: basically, you've to uninstall CS6 and reinstall it from the ground up then the patch will apply correctly.
