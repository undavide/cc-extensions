	<p>When you buy a product through Exchange, your purchase is linked to your AdobeID (likewise you'd do with apps on the iPhone). As long as you're working on a properly licensed copy of Photoshop (either as a Perpetual Product, Product Subscription or as a part of the Creative Cloud bundle) you're allowed to download, install and use Extensions and Scripts.</p>
	<p>If you're wondering on how many computers a Creative Cloud individual member can install on to, according to Adobe, please refer to the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/creativecloud/faq.html" target="_blank">FAQ</a>, which the relevant part is:</p>
	<dl style="margin:15px;">
		<dt>Can I use the software I download from Creative Cloud on multiple computers?</dt>
		<dd>Yes, you can install and activate Creative Cloud desktop applications on two computers, regardless of operating system, for the individual associated with the Creative Cloud membership. See the product license agreements page for more information.</dd>

	<p>4. Limitation of Liability. 
	You shall, at your own expense, indemnify, defend and hold Developer harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), damages, liabilities and expenses to the extent such claim arises out of: (a) any breach of this Agreement, (b) any claims or allegations made in connection with your use of a third party payment mechanism, © any breach or alleged breach of any representations and warranties made by a third party concerning any aspect of a Product, including but not limited to compatibility, (d) any claims made by or on behalf of any third party pertaining directly or indirectly to Your use of a Product, (e) any alleged or actual violation of your privacy or other rights by a third party, and (f) any allegations based on a product liability claim.</p>

You acknowledge that the fees and amounts payable set forth in this Agreement reflect the allocation of risk set forth in this Agreement and that the other party would not enter into this Agreement without these limitations on its liability. Each party agrees that these limitations shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy. The foregoing limitations of liability are independent of any exclusive remedies for breach of warranty set forth in this Agreement. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply.</p>

	<p>6. Export. 
	You acknowledge that the Products are subject to the U.S. export control and sanctions laws (including the Export Administration Regulations) (“Export Controls”) and that You will comply with the Export Controls.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code § 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”</p>

	This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be considered an original, but all of which together will constitute the same instrument. This Agreement, together with any Exhibits hereto, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, and communication, whether written or oral.</p>

	<p>9. Governing Law; Venue. 
	This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Italy, and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in Italy without regard to any conflicts of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. In any action or suit to enforce any right or remedy under this Agreement or to interpret any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees.
